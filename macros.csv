418,how we process GDPR data access requests - answer,"Hello [name]:

We write to acknowledge receipt of your email dated [date] regarding our process for responding to GDRP data access requests. At this time, we process GDPR data access requests via email.

The GDPR requires us to respond to data subject requests within one month of receipt. However, in certain circumstances, the GDPR or other applicable law allows us to extend that deadline by two months depending on the complexity of your request. However, we must verify your identity before we can respond to your data access request. You must provide identification that clearly shows your name, date of birth, and current address. We accept a photocopy or a scanned image of the following as proof of identity: passport or photo identification such as a driver’s license, national identification card, or birth or adoption certification. If you have changed your name, you must provide relevant documents evidencing the change. We only use the identification documentation provided by you to respond to your request and not for any other purpose. We will delete or destroy all identification after confirmation of your identity.

Our initial response letter to you may advise you that:

•        We require more information to verify your identity.
•        We need more information to respond to the request.
•        We require you to pay a fee before we respond to the request.

If we cannot honor the request, we will inform you of the reasons why, subject to any legal or regulatory restrictions.

Specifically, as to your last question, in response to a data subject access request, we will, unless an exemption applies under the GDPR, provide you with the following information about our personal data processing activities:

(a) The purpose of processing.
(b) Categories of personal data processed.
(c) Recipients or categories of recipients who receive personal data from us.
(d) How long we store the personal data, or the criteria we use to determine retention periods.
(e) Information on the personal data’s source if we do not collect it directly from the data subject.
(f) Information on the safeguards we use to secure transfers of personal data to non-EU countries or to an international organization.
(g) Whether we use automated decision-making, including profiling, the auto-decision logic used, and the consequences of this processing.
(h) Their right to:
                (i) request correction or erasure of their personal data;
                (ii) restrict or object to certain types of processing with respect to their personal data; and
                (iii) make a complaint with the local data protection authority.

Please note that most of the above information is already set out at [https://chatrandom.com/privacy/]

We will unless an exemption under the GDPR applies, provide you with a copy of the personal data we process about you in a commonly used electronic form.
